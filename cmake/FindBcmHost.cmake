# FindBcmHost
# -----------
#
# Try to find Broadcom libraries.
#
# It is meant as a drop-in replacement for FindEGL.cmake on Raspberry Pi
# systems.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
# ``BCM_HOST_FOUND``
#     True if bcm_host is available
# ``BCM_HOST_LIBRARIES``
#     This can be passed to target_link_libraries() instead of the ``BcmHost::BcmHost``
#     target
# ``BCM_HOSTL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
#     This should be passed to target_include_directories() if the target is not
#     used for linking
#
# If ``BCM_HOST_FOUND`` is TRUE, it will also define the following imported target:
#
# ``BcmHost::BcmHost``
#     The BcmHost library
#
# In general we recommend using the imported target, as it is easier to use.
# Bear in mind, however, that if the target is in the link interface of an
# exported library, it must be made available by the package config file.
#
# Since pre-1.0.0.
